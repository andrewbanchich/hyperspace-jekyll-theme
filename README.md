So I've had the wireframe for this particular design kicking around for some time, but with all
the other interesting (and in some cases, semi-secret) projects I've been working on it took me
a little while to get to actually designing and coding it. Fortunately, things have eased up
enough for me to finaly get around to it, so I'm happy to introduce Hyperspace: a fun, blocky,
one-page design with a lot of color, a bit of animation, and an additional "generic" page template
(because hey, even one-page sites usually need an interior page or two). Hope you dig it :)
